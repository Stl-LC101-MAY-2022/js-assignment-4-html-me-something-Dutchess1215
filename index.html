               <h2>The Greatest Story I Never Heard</h2>
               <p>Ladies and Gentleman! Dogs and cats! Cross-eyed mosquitos and bowlegged ants!
                  Admission is free, so pay at the door, pull up a chair and sit on the floor.
                  I come before you, to stand behind you to tell you a story I know nothing about!      
                 <br>
                  One bright morning in the middle of the night, two dead boys got up
                  to fight! Back to back they faced each other,
                  drew their swords and shot each other!
                  <br>
                  Now the deaf policeman heard this noise
                  and got up to shoot those two dead boys.
                  and if you don't believe my story, I promise 
                  it's true, just ask the blind man!
                  He saw it too.<br>
                  After finishing always have to do it faster, after doing it faster tell em you can do it backwards at which point you obviously just turn around and do it all again.

               <h3>The Skunk Song</h3>
               <p class="funParagraph">Welllllll I put my head in a little
                  skunk said 'Well bless my soul! 
                  Take it out! Take it out! Take it out!
                  Take it Out! Remooooove it!'<br>
                  Welllllll I didn't take it out and
                  the little skunk said 'You better take it
                  out or you'd had! Take it out! Take it out!
                  Take it out! Take it Out! Remoooove it!'<br>
